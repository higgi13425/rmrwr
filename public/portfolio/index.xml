This is a blog about working toward more reproducible medical research using R and associated tools, particularly those developed by RStudio.
Goals  Making it easier to share data. Making it easier to create literate code, and share this code. Training the next generation of medical researchers to use ROpenSci tools, open research, and to encourage others to evaluate their data and their code to improve it.</description>
