Data often arrive with many un-tidy features, including ugly variable (column) names that include spaces, punctuation, and unpredictable capitalization.

This makes data wrangling your variables difficult. One great tool to make this process easier is the janitor package, by Sam Firke @samfirke, from right here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Janitor has many useful functions (23 as of March 2018), but I will only focus on a few. The *clean_names* function is usually what brings people to the janitor package. I will start with an example. *clean_names* takes your variable names (column names) from a dataframe or tibble, and cleans them up. This means it: 
1. makes them all lower case
2. it strips out punctuation
3. it replaces spaces with single underscores

As an example:
```{r clean_names}
firstName <- c("Bob", "Jim", "Amy", "Alexa", "Siri")
`Last Name` <- c("Hamilton", "Jefferson", "Adams", "Johnson",           "Grant")
`add.ress` <- c("123 Jones St", "5 Smith Lane", "3 Jonson Blvd.", "17 Diaz Rd", "8 Garcia Court")
df <- as.data.frame(c(firstName, `Last Name`, `add.ress`))
df
```
