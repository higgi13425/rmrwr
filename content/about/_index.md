I am interested in making medical research more open and reproducible, using R and RStudio.
 
<br/>
I encourage trainees to learn R and to share data and code.
I rely on Rbasics, ModernDive, DataCamp, and R For Data Science as teaching tools.

My medical research is focused on inflammatory bowel disease.
